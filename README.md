# lem-in

### Project instruction
You can read the official instruction [from here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/lem-in) 

# Overview

This is a student project that helps learn about algorithms:
- minimum cost maximum flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Suurballe)
- path search in directed graphs (BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- efficient data representation (priority queues, graphs, arrays, queues, linked lists)
- ways to receive data
- ways to output data
- manipulation of strings
- manipulation of structures

# Run

> The program takes only one argument, which is a file name.
#### Example:
`go run ./cmd example.txt`

There are some ready examples can be found in the "maps" folder

# Algorithms

I want to thank [@almayor](https://github.com/almayor) for his detailed explanation of using minimum cost maximum flow problem.
You can read his [explanation from here](https://github.com/almayor/lem-in/blob/master/docs/algorithm-explanation.pdf)
Also I recommend read [Suurballe's algorithm](http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/Disjoint_Path_Finding), briefly explained by pictures
